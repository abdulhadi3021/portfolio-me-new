              I'm a full-stack developer with expertise in modern web technologies.
              My journey in tech began several years ago, and I've worked on various
              projects from small business websites to complex web applications.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning new technologies and contributing
              to open source projects. I believe in continuous learning and staying
              updated with the latest industry trends.
